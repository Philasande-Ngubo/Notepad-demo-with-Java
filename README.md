# Notepad-demo-with-Java
Hello.
</br></br>
This is a demo of a very classic program Notepad.</br>
I made this Program to have those notable functions that the windows 
Notepad have .</br><i>Ironic enough I coded this program using notepad.</i>
However I did not include a font picker </br> because the Javax swing library does no longer
come with it. </br>It would have been a rather tedious to make my own font Picker..
I added a themes feature with</br> 4 themes .I did not make this notepad to be customizable.
<b>The main method is on the "Main" class</b> </br>so run the main class to view the program.
<b> Download all the files including the image </b></br> to use this program to its full
capability.
</br></br>
<b><i>Enjoy...</i>
